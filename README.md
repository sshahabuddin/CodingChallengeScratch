Coding Challenge for Sractch Financial
The objective of this challenge is to call some endpoints containing a list of clinics and perform some actions on the result.
The list of clinics can be found at:
https://storage.googleapis.com/scratchpay-code-challenge/dental-clinics.json

Create one RESTful API endpoint to allow search in multiple clinic providers and display results from all the available clinics by any of the following:

Clinic Name
State [ex: "CA" or "California"]
Availability [ex: from:09:00, to:20:00]




To run this program, clone this repository, then cd into it and run: 
node CodeChallengeScratch.js

There are no depencies other than having Node.js installed on your machine
